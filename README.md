# Percolation Classification

The convolutional neural networks found in `src/model_L.py` were built to identify percolating clusters in 2D square lattices of size L = 4, 8, 16, 32.
The models were trained with data augmentation of reflecting vertically, reflecting horizontally, and transposing (because all of these augmentations leave the system's phase unchanged, but produce different orientations of percolating clusters allowing the model to generalize better).
All models perform extraordinarily well with test accuracies of >99.95%.
In the figure below we can see the test accuracy plotted against the site occupation probability p for the 32x32 lattice.

Ideally we would like to use models to try and determine where the percolation transition occurs, so the figure below shows the output probabilities (y_0 - not percolating, y_1 - percolating) of the model on test data.
It is also important to note that due to the stochastic nature of the way the data was generated, there are samples with p < p_c which have percolating clusters and samples with p > p_c which do not.
We observe that the curves of the predictions intersect at a point p < p_c for all lattice sizes, but as L increases we see the intersection move closer towards the critical probability p_c â‰ˆ 0.59274.

Below are visualizations of the 32x32 lattices that were misclassified.
Training sample 36458 was classified as not percolating when it actually was, whereas sample 92740 was classified as percolating when it actually wasn't.
Looking at the softmax output see that the probability for the correct classifications was non-negligible.
